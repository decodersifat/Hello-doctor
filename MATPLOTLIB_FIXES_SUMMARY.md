# Matplotlib PDF Generation Fixes

## Problem
The matplotlib plots were not being generated in the PDF reports, resulting in PDFs without the visual analysis images.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Matplotlib Backend Configuration**: The matplotlib backend wasn't properly configured for server environments
2. **File Path Issues**: Temporary image files were being saved in the wrong directory
3. **Error Handling**: No proper error handling for image generation failures
4. **Interactive Mode**: Matplotlib was running in interactive mode which can cause issues in server environments

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Module-Level Matplotlib Configuration**
```python
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('Agg')  # Use non-interactive backend
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
plt.ioff()  # Turn off interactive mode
```
- Set at module level to ensure it's applied before any plotting
- Uses 'Agg' backend which is designed for server environments
- Disables interactive mode to prevent GUI-related issues

### 2. **Improved Temporary File Handling**
```python
# Save the plot as a temporary image in a proper temp directory
import tempfile
temp_dir = tempfile.gettempdir()
temp_image_path = os.path.join(temp_dir, f"temp_plot_{slice_index}_{os.getpid()}.png")
```
- Uses system temp directory instead of current working directory
- Adds process ID to filename to avoid conflicts
- Proper path handling with `os.path.join()`

### 3. **Enhanced Error Handling**
```python
try:
    plt.savefig(temp_image_path, dpi=150, bbox_inches='tight', facecolor='white')
    plt.close()
    
    if os.path.exists(temp_image_path):
        pdf_canvas.drawImage(temp_image_path, x_position, y_position, width=image_width, height=image_height, mask='auto')
        print(f"Successfully added image {slice_index} to PDF")
    else:
        print(f"Warning: Image file not found at {temp_image_path}")
        
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error saving plot {slice_index}: {e}")
    plt.close()
finally:
    # Clean up the temporary image
    if os.path.exists(temp_image_path):
        try:
            os.remove(temp_image_path)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error removing temp file {temp_image_path}: {e}")
```
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks around image generation
- Proper cleanup of temporary files
- Detailed logging for debugging

### 4. **Better Image Quality Settings**
```python
plt.savefig(temp_image_path, dpi=150, bbox_inches='tight', facecolor='white')
```
- Higher DPI (150) for better image quality
- `bbox_inches='tight'` to remove extra whitespace
- `facecolor='white'` for consistent background

### 5. **Improved Plot Configuration**
```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 6))
ax.imshow(img[:, :, n_slice, 0], cmap="gray") 
ax.imshow(test_prediction_argmax[:, :, n_slice], alpha=0.5, cmap='coolwarm')
ax.set_title(f"Slice {n_slice + 1}")
ax.axis('off')
```
- Fixed figure size for consistent output
- Proper overlay of segmentation mask on MRI image
- Clean titles and no axis labels

## Test Results

### âœ… **Successful Test Output**
```
Matplotlib backend: Agg
Generating PDF with 3D prediction data
Found 15 valid slices to process
Processing slice 0: slice 10
Created plot for slice 10
Successfully added image 0 to PDF
...
âœ… Successfully generated PDF: test_mri_report.pdf
   File size: 474449 bytes
âœ… PDF appears to be properly generated
```

### **Key Improvements**
1. **15 valid slices processed** - All slices with tumor regions are being processed
2. **All images successfully added** - No failures in image generation or PDF integration
3. **Large file size (474KB)** - Indicates images are properly embedded
4. **Clean error handling** - No crashes or unhandled exceptions

## Current Status

### âœ… **Working Features**
1. **Matplotlib Integration**: Plots are generated correctly with 'Agg' backend
2. **Image Quality**: High-quality images with proper DPI and formatting
3. **PDF Integration**: Images are properly embedded in PDF reports
4. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling prevents crashes
5. **File Management**: Proper cleanup of temporary files
6. **Multi-slice Processing**: All valid slices are processed and included

### ðŸ”§ **Technical Details**
- **Backend**: Agg (non-interactive, server-friendly)
- **DPI**: 150 (high quality)
- **Format**: PNG with white background
- **Layout**: 3-column grid with proper spacing
- **Cleanup**: Automatic temporary file removal

## Usage

The MRI processing system now generates comprehensive PDF reports that include:

1. **Patient Information**: Name, age, and analysis results
2. **Visual Analysis**: Multiple MRI slices with tumor segmentation overlays
3. **Professional Formatting**: Clean layout with proper spacing
4. **High-Quality Images**: Clear, detailed medical images

The matplotlib integration is now fully functional and will generate professional-looking medical reports with visual analysis of the MRI scans!
